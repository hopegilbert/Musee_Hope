                <h1>Introduction</h1>

                <p>The relationship between visual experience and cognitive estimation when viewing objects remains a fundamental question in perceptual psychology. Vision involves the initial sensory processing of an object's features, such as its shape, color, and texture, as captured by the eyes and transmitted to the brain. Cognitive estimation, on the other hand, involves higher-level processes where the brain interprets these sensory inputs to form a coherent understanding of the object's intrinsic properties, such as its true shape, material composition, and function. This dissertation explores whether our estimation of an object's intrinsic properties comes before or after our visual experience of the object. The central question is whether cognitive processes influence our initial visual experience or if they operate independently, or if they interact in a more complex manner, potentially occurring in parallel or influencing each other reciprocally (Palmer, 1999).</p>

                <p>Historically, thinkers like Aristotle, von Helmholtz, and contemporary vision scientists like Mark McCourt, posited that visual experience must precede cognitive estimation. Aristotle suggested that perception starts with the reception of sensory data, which is then processed by the mind to form an understanding of the object. Von Helmholtz, a pioneer in the field of physiological optics, emphasized that perception involves unconscious inferences, where the brain interprets sensory inputs based on prior knowledge and experiences (Helmholtz, 1867). McCourt built on these ideas, arguing that visual experience provides the raw data that the cognitive system needs to interpret the physical properties of objects (McCourt, 2001). Robert H. Thouless's work on phenomenal regression to the real object significantly contributed to this debate, presenting evidence contrary to the positions of  Aristotle, von Helmhotz, and McCourt, by demonstrating that visual experiences are influenced by knowledge of an object's true shape, indicating a compromise between retinal images and cognitive estimations (Thouless, 1931). Thouless's experiments showed that when subjects viewed an inclined circle, they often perceived it as more circular than it should have appeared from a perspectival projection onto the retina , suggesting that cognitive estimations of shape influence visual experience. This finding challenged the notion that visual experience and cognitive estimation are entirely separate processes, highlighting their interdependence.</p>

                <p>In contemporary perceptual psychology, it is understood that both visual experience and cognitive estimation are likely occur in the cerebral cortex. Advances in neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience have shown that regions of the brain involved in visual processing, such as the occipital lobe, are closely connected to areas responsible for higher-order cognitive functions, like the prefrontal cortex (Ungerleider & Haxby, 1994). This interconnectedness raises questions about the sequence and interaction between these processes. While traditional views separated experience from cognitive processes, modern research suggests a more integrated approach, where sensation and cognition are seen as dynamically interacting systems (Clark, 2013). However, the exact nature of this integration—whether cognitive estimation precedes, follows, or occurs concurrently with visual experience —remains unclear. This ambiguity necessitates experimental approaches to resolve the debate. Understanding this relationship is crucial for a comprehensive theory of perception, as it impacts how we understand the processing of complex visual environments, object recognition, and even perceptual learning and adaptation.</p>

                <p>To address this research question, it is essential to examine contemporary studies that explore the interplay between visual experience and cognitive estimation, building on Thouless's foundational work. These studies provide insights into how perceptual constancies are maintained, how cognitive factors influence visual experiences, and the methodological approaches that can be employed to disentangle these processes. I will briefly summarize a range of contemporary studies, explain whether or not they are consistent with Thouless' position that cognitive estimates of objects' properties influence our context-dependent experience of those objects.</p>

                <p>The paper "Stability by Degrees: Conceptions of Constancy from the History of Perceptual Psychology" by Louise Daoust explores how our perception of the environment relates to the physical facts of that environment, particularly focusing on the concept of perceptual constancy. Daoust's exploration of perceptual constancy suggests that cognitive processes contribute to perceptual stability. Perceptual constancy refers to the phenomenon where the perceived properties of an object remain relatively constant despite changes in the sensory input, such as viewing angle or lighting conditions (Daoust, 2021). Daoust's research indicates that our cognitive understanding of an object's properties, such as its shape and color, plays a crucial role in maintaining this stability. This aligns with Thouless's findings, indicating that cognitive estimation influences visual experience, leading to a more stable perceptual experience. By examining the historical context and experimental evidence, Daoust provides a comprehensive view of how cognitive processes underpin perceptual constancy, supporting the notion that cognitive estimation is integral to visual experience. In summary, Daoust's paper supports and extends Thouless's findings by discussing the historical context and philosophical implications of perceptual constancy. Both emphasize the complex nature of perception, where experiences are influenced by both proximal stimuli and the actual properties of objects, resulting in a perception that is stable to a degree but not fully invariant.</p>

                <p>The paper "Psychological Experiments and Phenomenal Experience in Size and Shape Constancy" by Gary Hatfield explores the distinction between phenomenal experience (how objects are perceived) and cognitive assessments (beliefs about the properties of objects) in the context of size and shape constancy. Hatfield's work distinguishes between phenomenal experiences (the immediate sensory experience) and cognitive assessments (the interpretation and understanding of those experiences). He argues that cognitive estimation influences visual experience, shaping how we interpret and respond to sensory inputs. Hatfield's experiments on shape and size constancy—where objects are perceived as having the same shape and size despite changes in viewing conditions—provide historical context and methodological insights, reinforcing the need to separate perceptual experience from cognitive judgments in experimental designs (Hatfield, 2014). His research highlights the complexity of perceptual processes and the necessity of carefully designed experiments to understand the interplay between sensory inputs and cognitive interpretations. In summary, Hatfield's paper reinforces and builds upon Thouless's research by defending the experimental methods used to study perceptual constancy and emphasizing the distinction between how objects are phenomenally experienced and cognitively assessed. Both researchers agree on the importance of understanding the compromise between retinal images and actual object properties in perceptual constancy.</p>

                <p>The paper "Sustained Representation of Perspectival Shape" by Jorge Morales, Axel Bax, and Chaz Firestone argues that our perception of objects retains information about their perspectival shapes (the shapes projected onto our eyes) even when we know their actual (distal) shapes. This challenges the traditional view that perception primarily reflects the true properties of objects in the world. The findings on the representation of perspectival shapes by Morales, Bax, and Firestone suggest a complex interaction between perception and cognition. Their research indicates that even when an object's actual shape is known, its perspectival shape—how it appears from a specific viewpoint—remains a significant part of the visual experience (Morales et al., 2020). This resonates with Thouless's results, showing that cognitive factors influence how we perceive shapes from different perspectives. Their studies demonstrate that the brain retains information about both the true shape and the perspectival shape, suggesting that cognitive estimation and visual experience are deeply intertwined. The research by Morales, Bax, and Firestone does extend and build on Thouless's findings by providing more nuanced evidence that perspectival shapes have a lasting impact on perception. However, it diverges by suggesting a dual representation rather than a simple compromise, indicating that both perspectival and actual shapes coexist in our perceptual experience. This adds a layer of complexity to Thouless's original concept by showing that the retinal image's influence is not merely a compromise but a persistent feature of perception.</p>

                <p>The paper "Perceptual Constancy and the Dimensions of Perceptual Experience" by John O'Dea explores the nature of perceptual constancy and the instability of perceptual experience. The central argument is that perceptual constancy involves managing ambiguities in perceptual conditions, such as illumination or orientation, and that these experiences are structured within a complex "quality space" that captures both stable and unstable aspects of perception. O'Dea's dimensional approach to perceptual constancy complements Thouless's insights, emphasizing the interplay of stability and cognitive factors in perception. O'Dea argues that perceptual constancy involves not just the stabilization of perceived properties, but also a dynamic interaction between different dimensions of perception, such as spatial orientation and contextual factors (O'Dea, 2020). This supports the view that perceptual constancy involves complex interactions between perception and cognition. By integrating multiple dimensions of perceptual experience, O'Dea's work provides a richer understanding of how cognitive processes contribute to the stability of visual experience. O'Dea's research aligns with Thouless's foundational ideas on perceptual constancy, particularly the concept of perceptual experiences as compromises between retinal images and actual properties. However, O'Dea expands upon these ideas by introducing the framework of quality spaces and categorizing perceptual dimensions as integral or separable. This refinement provides a more detailed and structured understanding of how perceptual constancy operates, incorporating both stability and instability in perceptual experience. Overall, O'Dea's work builds on and enhances Thouless's findings, offering deeper insights into the complexity of perceptual constancy.</p>

                <p>The paper "Are Perspectival Shapes Seen or Imagined? An Experimental Approach" by John Schwenkler and Assaf Weksler explores whether the perspectival shapes of objects (e.g., the elliptical appearance of a tilted coin) are a part of visual experience or if they are constructed in the imagination. Schwenkler and Weksler's methodology for determining if perspectival shapes are seen or imagined parallels Thouless' approach. Their experiments involve tasks that require participants to identify shapes from various perspectives, testing whether these shapes are part of the visual experience or constructed through imagination (Schwenkler & Weksler, 2018). Their work suggests that cognitive estimation might play a significant role in shaping our visual experience, a concept central to this dissertation. Their findings indicate that perspectival shapes are not merely imagined but are an integral part of visual experience, influenced by cognitive processes. Overall, Schwenkler and Weksler's research aligns with Thouless's in its focus on the complexity of perceptual experience and the factors that influence it. Both recognize that perception is not straightforwardly a reflection of the external world but is mediated by various factors, whether they be retinal images or cognitive constructions. Schwenkler and Weksler build on Thouless's foundational ideas by introducing modern experimental techniques and cognitive psychology concepts to further investigate the nature of perceptual constancy and the experience of perspectival shapes. This alignment and expansion provide a deeper understanding of how we perceive shapes and constancies in our visual environment.</p>

                <p>The paper "The Effects of Three-Dimensional Context on Shape Perception" by Margaret E. Sereno, Kelly E. Robles, Atsushi Kikumoto, and Alexander J. Bies investigates how three-dimensional (3D) context influences the perception of shape. Sereno et al. 's study on the influence of 3D context on shape perception supports Thouless's findings about the significant role of cognitive context in visual experience. Their results highlight how 3D context aids objective shape judgment while hindering projective judgments, underscoring the importance of cognitive influences on visual experience (Sereno et al., 2020). By examining how the brain integrates three-dimensional contextual information to form stable percepts, their work provides further evidence of the interplay between cognitive estimation and visual experience, reinforcing the need for an integrated approach to understanding perceptual processes. The research by Sereno et al. builds on and extends Thouless's foundational ideas on perceptual constancy by providing more detailed and specific insights into the role of 3D context. Both sets of research underscore the complexity of perceptual processes and the interplay between retinal images and actual object properties, demonstrating that perception is influenced by various contextual and viewing conditions. Thus, Sereno et al.'s findings are well-aligned with Thouless's research, while also contributing new knowledge through advanced experimental techniques and a specific focus on 3D context.</p>

                <p>The experiment described in this dissertation was derived from the first experiment reported in Thouless 1931 paper. Both explore how observers experience the 'roundness' of a circular object seen from a viewpoint at an angle to the object. Thouless asked his participants to draw the shape they experienced. In the current study we present our observers with a series of ellipses on a computer screen and ask them to report whether each ellipse is 'rounder' or 'thinner' than the experience elicited by the circular object.  Our circular object was the rim of a Durham University Psychology Department coffee mug viewed from one of two different angles: 20 degrees and 40 degrees. The test stimuli consisted of a series of computer generated ellipses with varying degrees of roundness. Participants used buttons on the computer to indicate whether each ellipse appeared rounder or thinner than the mug's rim. At a 20-degree angle, the mug's rim was positioned further from the participants, while at a 40-degree angle, it was closer. The ellipses we generated so that one corresponded in shape to the perspective projection of a circle at the angle the mug was viewed from. There were four ellipses with progressively larger aspect ratios (i.e. they were thinner) and four with smaller aspect ratios. We used the proportion of 'rounder' responses made to each aspect ratio to fit a psychometric function and so estimate the shape of ellipse that corresponded to the observer's experience.</p>

                <p>When the mug was viewed at a 20-degree angle, its rim appeared more elliptical (thinner). In this scenario, participants were expected to rely more heavily on their cognitive knowledge of the mug's intrinsic round shape to maintain perceptual constancy. This reliance on prior knowledge is anticipated to be more pronounced in the 20-degree condition due to the greater discrepancy between the visual input and the participants' understanding of the mug's true shape. Participants might adjust their visual experience to align more closely with their cognitive estimation of the rim's roundness.</p>

                <p>We hypothesise that in the 20-degree viewing condition, participants will report fewer 'rounder' responses, indicating a perception of the CGI stimuli as less round than the actual mug rim. This result would suggest that participants perceive the rim as rounder when it is viewed at a distance, supporting the notion that cognitive estimation of an object's intrinsic properties influences and precedes visual experience. These findings would align with Thouless's observations, demonstrating that cognitive knowledge of an object's true shape affects perceptual judgments and highlighting the interplay between cognitive processes and visual experience.</p>

                <p>Building on these insights, the proposed experiment aims to determine whether cognitive estimation occurs before visual experience or if they occur independently or in parallel. This experiment addresses gaps and methodological issues identified in the reviewed literature, including Thouless's study. Using modern psychophysical methods, participants will make simple binary decisions about shapes, reducing cognitive influences on their judgments. By simplifying the task to binary decisions, the experiment minimizes the potential for cognitive biases and focuses on the perceptual processes involved. This approach allows for a clearer examination of the sequence and interaction between visual experience and cognitive estimation.</p>

                <p>The main goals of this experiment are:</p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>To determine whether the estimation of an object's intrinsic properties occurs before the visual experience or if they occur independently or in parallel. This will be achieved by analysing the response times and accuracy of participants' judgments under controlled conditions.</li>
                    <li>To assess the consistency of visual judgments across real objects and realistic computer-generated images (CGI). By comparing responses to real and CGI objects, the study aims to understand the robustness of perceptual processes and the influence of realism on cognitive estimation.</li>
                    <li>To examine the influence of viewing conditions and decision time on visual judgments. By varying the viewing conditions and the time allowed for decisions, the experiment will explore how these factors affect the interplay between visual experience and cognitive estimation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By integrating historical and contemporary perspectives, this dissertation aims to provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between cognitive estimation and visual experience. The proposed experiment, informed by the foundational work of Thouless and supported by modern research, seeks to clarify whether cognitive processes precede, follow, or occur concurrently with visual experience. This research contributes to the broader understanding of perceptual constancy and the cognitive processes underlying shape perception. Understanding these relationships will enhance our knowledge of how the brain integrates sensory and cognitive information to produce coherent and stable perceptions of the world.</p>
