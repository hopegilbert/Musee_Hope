                <h1>Methodology</h1>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>The study employed a repeated measures design, which allowed each participant to experience both levels of the independent variable: the viewing angles of the mug at 20 degrees and 40 degrees. This design was chosen to control for individual differences in perception and ensure that any observed effects were due to the manipulation of the viewing angle rather than variability between participants. The dependent variable was the number of times participants selected the 'rounder' option when comparing the CGI discs to the real mug's rim.</p>

                <h2>Participants</h2>
                <p>Three participants (2 males and 1 female) from Durham University participated in the study. Their ages ranged from 22 to 26 years. All participants reported having normal eyesight. The small sample size was strategically chosen to address the research question efficiently, following Aristotle's principle of careful and thorough investigation with a focused group. Taking a psychophysical approach in which a small number of participants make a large number of decisions over a carefully chose range of stimuli allows statistical analyses to be conducted at the level of individual observers is likely to produce clearer results than a groups study in which smaller numbers of trials lead to inaccurate estimates of each observers experience.</p>

                <h2>Apparatus and Materials</h2>
                <p>The experimental setup included several key components designed to ensure precision and consistency:</p>
                
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Chin Rest: A chin rest was used to stabilize participants' heads, ensuring that their viewing angle remained constant throughout the experiment. This device was crucial for maintaining consistent eye level and minimizing head movement, which could affect perception.</li>
                    <li>Mug and CGI Ellipses: A real mug was used as the reference object. The stimuli consisted of a sequence of CGI ellipses with varying degrees of roundness, designed to mimic the rim of the mug. These ellipses had black contours and were presented on a plain white background to eliminate any potential distractions or contextual influences.</li>
                    <li>MATLAB Programming Platform: The experiment was controlled using MATLAB (Mathworks, N.D.), which managed the presentation of stimuli and recorded responses. MATLAB was also used to measure and adjust the distance of the mug to achieve the correct viewing angles for each condition.</li>
                    <li>Laptop and Stand: The laptop displaying the stimuli was positioned on a stand to align with the participants' eye level from the table top. This setup ensured that the visual stimuli were presented consistently across trials and participants.</li>
                </ul>
