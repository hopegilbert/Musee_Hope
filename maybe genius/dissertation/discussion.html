                <h1>Discussion</h1>

                <p>The findings of this dissertation offer significant insights into the intricate relationship between cognitive estimation and visual experience. The study aimed to determine whether cognitive processes precede, follow, or occur concurrently with visual experiences. By revisiting Thouless's seminal experiments with a modern methodological approach, we have garnered evidence that supports the notion that cognitive estimation significantly influences visual experience, particularly under certain conditions.</p>

                <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
                <p>The results show that in the majority of conditions tested (4 out of 5 measurable conditions), participants' perceptions deviated significantly from objective equality. This suggests that cognitive estimations of an object's intrinsic properties, such as the roundness of the mug's rim, indeed influence visual experience. Specifically:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>20-Degree Viewing Angle: Both Participant 1 and Participant 3 showed a significant perceptual shift, indicating that their cognitive estimations of the mug's intrinsic roundness influenced their visual judgments. This aligns with Thouless's findings and suggests that when the visual task is more challenging due to greater perspective distortion, cognitive processes play a more prominent role in maintaining perceptual constancy.</li>
                    <li>40-Degree Viewing Angle: The results were mixed. Participant 1's results suggested that cognitive estimation did not significantly distort visual experience under this condition, which contrasts with Thouless's theory. However, Participant 3 exhibited a significant perceptual shift, consistent with Thouless's observations. Participant 2, due to the difficulty of the task, was unable to provide meaningful data in this condition.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>These findings suggest that cognitive estimation and visual experience interact in a complex manner, where the influence of cognitive processes may vary depending on the viewing conditions and the perceived difficulty of the task.</p>

                <h2>Implications for Perceptual Psychology</h2>
                <p>The results contribute to the ongoing debate on whether cognitive estimation precedes or follows visual experience or whether they occur concurrently. The study provides evidence that supports the integration of cognitive processes and visual experience, aligning with contemporary views in perceptual psychology that advocate for a more dynamic and interconnected understanding of perception (Clark, 2013).</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Perceptual Constancy: The findings reinforce the concept of perceptual constancy, where cognitive factors contribute to the stability of visual experience despite changes in sensory input. This supports Daoust's (2021) argument that cognitive processes underpin perceptual stability and are integral to maintaining consistent perceptions of object properties across varying conditions.</li>
                    <li>Cognitive Influence on Perception: The significant shifts observed in the 20-degree condition highlight the role of cognitive estimations in visual experience, suggesting that our understanding of an object's intrinsic properties can influence how we perceive it from different perspectives. This finding extends Thouless's work and aligns with Hatfield's (2014) and Morales et al.'s (2020) research on the interplay between sensory inputs and cognitive interpretations.</li>
                    <li>Interaction of Sensory and Cognitive Processes: The study shows that sensory and cognitive processes do not operate in isolation but rather interact in a complex manner. This interaction is particularly evident under challenging visual conditions, where cognitive estimations seem to play a more significant role in shaping visual experience. This supports the integrated approach to perception proposed by contemporary researchers like Clark (2013), who argue that perception is a dynamic interplay of sensory inputs and cognitive processes.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Methodological Considerations</h2>
                <p>The experimental design, which involved a small number of participants making a large number of decisions, provided robust statistical analyses at the individual level. This approach allowed for a detailed examination of perceptual processes and minimized the influence of individual variability. However, the study's small sample size also presents limitations, necessitating further research with larger and more diverse participant groups to validate and extend these findings.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Small Sample Size: While the focused approach of using a small sample size with numerous trials per participant allows for detailed individual-level analysis, it limits the generalizability of the findings. Future research should involve a larger and more diverse sample to ensure that the results are broadly applicable.</li>
                    <li>Task Difficulty and Variability: The variability in task difficulty across different viewing angles highlights the need for future studies to systematically vary viewing angles and task complexities. This would help to better understand the conditions under which cognitive estimations most strongly influence visual experience.</li>
                    <li>Integration of Neuroimaging Techniques: Incorporating neuroimaging techniques in future studies could provide deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the interaction between cognitive and perceptual processes. This could help to identify specific brain regions involved in integrating sensory and cognitive information during visual experience.</li>
                    <li>Experimental Design Improvements: Future experiments should consider incorporating additional control conditions and varying the types of objects and perspectives used. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive estimation influences visual experience across different contexts and object types.</li>
