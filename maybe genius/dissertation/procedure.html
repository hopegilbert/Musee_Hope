                <h1>Procedure</h1>

                <p>The experiment was conducted individually in a well-lit laboratory at Durham University to ensure a controlled environment and consistency across participants. The procedure was as follows:</p>

                <ol class="numbered-list">
                    <li>Preparation: Participants were seated comfortably at a desk and instructed to place their heads on the chin rest. The height of their eyes was measured with a tape measure, and this measurement was input into MATLAB, which then computed the correct position for the mug to achieve the desired viewing angles of 20 degrees and 40 degrees.</li>

                    <li>Stimulus Presentation: Participants were exposed to 30 blocks of trials, with 15 blocks at a 20-degree viewing angle and 15 blocks at a 40-degree viewing angle. Each block contained 90 trials (ten for each aspect ratio of ellipse), resulting in a total of 1,350 trials per viewing angle condition and 2,700  trials per participant. However,  participant 1 could only complete 10 blocks of each trials for reasons of limited time. Meaning one participant did 900 trials per angle condition and 1,800 trials in total.</li>

                    <li>Task Instructions: Participants were instructed to respond to each visual stimulus (CGI ellipses) by pressing the '.' key if they perceived the disc as thinner than the mug's rim or the ',' key if they perceived it as rounder. There were no time constraints imposed, allowing participants to take as much time as needed to ensure accurate responses.</li>

                    <li>Trial Execution: Each CGI disc was displayed within the participant's eyeline, and the next disc appeared only after a response was made. This ensured that participants had sufficient time to compare each disc to the mug's rim without feeling rushed.</li>

                    <li>Data Collection: For each block, a score was recorded, reflecting the frequency with which participants pressed the ',' (rounder) key. This score indicated how often participants perceived the displayed stimuli as rounder compared to the actual rim of the mug.</li>

                    <li>Consistency and Control: The individual nature of the experiment in a controlled laboratory setting ensured that external variables were minimized, providing consistency across participants and trials.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The aim was to determine whether the cognitive estimation of an object's intrinsic properties, such as the roundness of the mug's rim, precedes or influences visual experience. By comparing responses across different viewing angles, the study sought to reveal the shape of ellipse corresponding to the observer's experience. If this shape was significantly different to the shape of the geometrically correct perspectival projection of a circle at the given viewing angle this would indicate that prior knowledge and cognitive processes affect experience, thereby contributing to the ongoing debate on the interplay between cognitive estimation and visual experience.</p>
