                <h1>Deep and Meaningful Learning</h1>
                <h2>Critical Evaluation of Long-term Memory Encoding</h2>

                <p>Deep and meaningful learning 'includes inquiry, critical thinking, creative thinking, problem-solving, and metacognitive skills'. Meaningful learning is not just one kind of learning but draws upon a number of techniques that assist in encoding information. Encoding is the way we change information into a format that can be stored in the different memory stores. Information arrives in the sensory register in its original form (e.g. sound, visual) and then goes through different processes depending on where it will be stored. Information is moved from short-term memory to long-term memory through rehearsal. Evidence shows that long-term memory is encoded semantically (Baddeley 1966). Long term memory can last a lifetime but recognition is better than recall (Bahrick et al (1975). Once information is encoded it can be recalled, through retrieval, from long term memory.</p>

                <h2>Elaborate Rehearsal and Memory Encoding</h2>
                <p>Elaborate rehearsal shows evidence for meaningful learning leading to the best LTM encoding. For example, in a study by Gardiner, Gawlik, and Richardson-Klavehn they stated that 'Maintenance rehearsal affects knowing, not remembering; elaborative rehearsal affects remembering, not knowing'. 80 words were divided into 2 conditions: short and long cue delay. A cue can trigger a memory. Cues can be indirectly linked because of encoding at the same time as learning or can be meaningful. Half of the participants (pps) received short first and the other half received long first. Within each condition half the words were designated to be forgotten and half to be learned. After one day the pps had to circle their 40 learned words from a list of 160. They were also told to write R (for recognising) and K (for knowing) if the words were in the study. Their findings were nearly all significant and pointed to their hypothesis being correct.</p>

                <h2>Retrieval Failure Theory</h2>
                <p>Retrieval failure theory does not support the claim that meaningful learning always leads to the best long-term memory encoding. People forget information because of insufficient cues. When information is encoded in memory cues of association are stored at the same time. If at the time of recall, the cues aren't available it can appear that the information has been forgotten, however, this is just due to retrieval failure theory- therefore the memory is still there it just cannot be accessed. This is supported by Tulving, 1973 'what is stored is determined by what is perceived and how it is encoded, and what is stored determines what retrieval queues are effective in providing access to what is stored.'</p>

                <h2>Transfer Appropriate Processing</h2>
                <p>More evidence to support the idea that deep and meaningful learning does not always lead to the best long-term memory encoding comes from transfer appropriate processing. Deeper processing does not always lead to a better performance. For prior learning to be displayed in a test, it must have to have the same processing conditions that were present at encoding. In a study by Fisher and Craik (1977) pps were presented with 2 types of word pairs- the capitalised word had to be learned. E.g. rhyme CAT-bat vs associate CAT-dog. These were the two learning conditions rhyme vs. Associative context. The cued recall was rhyme vs associative retrieval cues.</p>

                <h2>Total Time Hypothesis and Practice</h2>
                <p>We can also look at Herman Ebbinghaus's total time hypothesis as perhaps not solid evidence for the claim that deeper and meaningful processing always leads to the best long-term memory encoding, but as something that attributes to better encoding. This can be shown in a study by Ericsson et al. (1993). The total time hypothesis coined by Ebbinghaus (1985) states that the more time you invest in learning the greater the learning benefits and more material is retained.</p>

                <h2>Expanding Retrieval and Testing Effects</h2>
                <p>Leading on from the idea that long term memory encoding is not just bettered by the time spent practising but it is about deliberate practice, studies into expanding retrieval support this claim, and the claim that deep and meaningful learning always leads to the best long-term memory encoding. Expanding is not just repetition, but is best explained by two combined principles. Pashler et al, 2007 looked at the distribution of practice/ spacing effect. His paper looked at the interaction between the inter-study and the retention interval and found that the optimum inter-study interval should be 10-20% of the retention interval.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>To conclude, findings from the papers and practitioners mentioned above show that specific learning techniques, that fall under the category of deep and meaningful learning processes, does lead to the best long-term memory encoding. The use of mediators and testing are examples of how learning can evolve from just studying and instead be deeper and more meaningful, for better retention and recall. However, the evidence does not show that deep and meaningful learning processes always leads to the best long term memory encoding. Evidence from Tulving shows that insufficient cues can lead to retrieval failure, meaning that even if we have information encoded in our long term memory, we cannot always access it.</p>
