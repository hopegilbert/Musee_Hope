                <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
                <p>Clinically known as Autism Spectrum Condition according to the DSM-5</p>
                <blockquote>"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a 'developmental disorder' because symptoms generally appear in the first 2 years of life."</blockquote>
                <p class="citation">(National Institute of Mental Health, 2022)</p>
                <p>It affects interaction, communication, learning and behaviour.<br>
                Can be diagnosed at any age but symptoms tend to appear in early life, therefore described as a developmental disorder.</p>
                <p>Autism is a part of neurodiversity.</p>

                <h2>Autism is a Part of Neurodiversity</h2>
                <p>Neurodiversity is defined as:</p>
                <blockquote>"the range of differences in individual brain function and behavioural traits, regarded as part of normal variation in the human population"</blockquote>
                <div class="image-space"></div>
                <p>Autism is not a linear spectrum but rather made up of many aspects that are affected differently.</p>

                <h2>What is Sensory Processing?</h2>
                <p>Sensory input is captured via receptors:</p>
                <h3>External Stimuli:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Auditory</li>
                    <li>Visual</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The input is then transformed into sensory information.</li>
                    <li>The sensory information is then sent to the brain to be processed and organised.</li>
                    <li>The brain then determines a motor and behavioural response.</li>

                <h2>Perceptual Experience</h2>
                <p>Perceptual experience is influenced by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Incoming sensory information</li>
                    <li>Prior knowledge held about the world</li>

                <p>Predicts an outcome based on previous observations along with information from the current situation</p>
                <p>Can be used to show the differences in perceptual mechanisms in autistic people.</p>
                <p>Pellicano and Burr's account assumes that perceptual atypicalities occur because autistic people are less influenced by their prior knowledge.</p>

                <h2>What are Sensory Differences?</h2>
                <p>Sensory differences can be different experiences with our senses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sight</li>
                    <li>Hearing</li>
                    <li>Smell</li>
                    <li>Taste</li>
                    <li>Touch</li>
                    <li>Proprioception (bodily awareness)</li>
                    <li>Vestibular (balance)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These experiences can change interactions and how someone physically feels.</p>
                <p>Sensory difference are not specific to autistic people, people with ADHD, OCD or developmental delays can have them too.</p>

                <p>Research into the anxiety and possible sensory triggers in autistic people can help us to understand and research causes of autism and intervention treatment.</p>
                <p>Most research focuses on Sensory Over-Reactivity in autistic people, but I want to focus on research that looks into all the different types of sensory reactivity differences.</p>
                <p>This approach is more beneficial and progressive than only focusing on hyperreactivity.</p>

                <h3>The Relationship Between Sensory Reactivity Differences and Anxiety Subtypes in Autistic Children</h3>
                <p>The study used 41 autistic children (who all had a clinical diagnosis) aged 3–14 using parent and self-report measures to report anxiety and sensory differences.</p>
                <h3>Findings:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sensory hyperreactivity was related to phobia-related symptoms</li>
                    <li>Sensory hyporeactivity was related to social anxiety</li>
                    <li>Sensory seeking was not related to anxiety</li>

                <h3>The Perceived Causal Relations Between Sensory Reactivity Differences and Anxiety Symptoms in Autistic Adults</h3>
                <p>The study used 246 autistic adults aged 18–76 in an online study.<br>
                Used self-report assessments of sensory reactivity differences and anxiety, followed by a perceived causal relations scale to indicate whether they thought their sensory reactivity differences were more of a cause or an effect of their anxiety symptoms.</p>
                <h3>Findings:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>All types of sensory reactivity were correlated with anxiety</li>
                    <li>Hyperreactivity was perceived to be a cause rather than an effect</li>
                    <li>Seeking was perceived to be an effect rather than a cause</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Positives:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the first studies to explore perceived causal relationships between reactivity differences and anxiety</li>
                    <li>Self-report allows for direct assessment of participants' subjective experiences</li>
                    <li>Large sample size enhances generalisability</li>
                    <li>Suggests cause vs. effect insight, with positive implications for assessment and treatment</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Negatives:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Self-report can introduce bias</li>
                    <li>Did not examine other contributing factors such as executive function or social support</li>
                    <li>Did not include a control group of non-autistic people for comparison</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why is This a Good Study?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Addresses important research that can be used to develop effective treatments for this demographic</li>
                    <li>Uses reliable and valid self-report measures</li>
                    <li>Large sample size increases generalisability</li>
                    <li>Statistical analysis strengthens validity</li>
                    <li>Adds to the limited research in this area with implications for assessment, research, and treatment</li>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>There are many studies that look into the relationship between sensory differences and anxiety in autistic people.<br>
                I think these two studies are the most useful in understanding the direction of research, whereas earlier studies tend to focus only on hyperreactivity and sensory over-reactivity.</p>
                <p>These papers explore the variations in sensory reactivity.</p>
                <p>A lot more research needs to be done, as these studies have limitations. However, it seems that understanding the relationship between sensory processing differences and anxiety in autistic people is key to developing effective interventions.</p>
