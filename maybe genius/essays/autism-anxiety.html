                <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
                <p>Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, sensory processing, and patterns of behavior. It represents a natural variation in human neurodiversity, affecting how individuals perceive, process, and interact with the world around them.</p>

                <p>Recent research emphasizes viewing autism through a neurodiversity lens, recognizing it as a difference rather than a deficit. This perspective acknowledges the unique strengths and challenges that come with being autistic.</p>

            <section id="sensory">
                <h2>Sensory Processing</h2>
                <p>Sensory processing refers to how our nervous system receives, organizes, and responds to sensory information from our environment and our bodies. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visual information (sight)</li>
                    <li>Auditory information (sound)</li>
                    <li>Tactile information (touch)</li>
                    <li>Proprioceptive information (body position)</li>
                    <li>Vestibular information (movement and balance)</li>
                    <li>Interoceptive information (internal bodily sensations)</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="differences">
                <h2>Sensory Differences</h2>
                <p>Autistic individuals often experience sensory information differently from non-autistic individuals. These differences can include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hyper-sensitivity (heightened responses to sensory input)</li>
                    <li>Hypo-sensitivity (reduced responses to sensory input)</li>
                    <li>Sensory seeking behaviors</li>
                    <li>Sensory avoiding behaviors</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Anxiety</h2>
                <p>Anxiety is more prevalent in autistic individuals compared to the general population. This increased prevalence may be related to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sensory overwhelm</li>
                    <li>Social communication differences</li>
                    <li>Difficulty with uncertainty</li>
                    <li>Executive functioning challenges</li>

                <h2>Research on Sensory Differences and Anxiety</h2>
                <p>Recent research has highlighted the significant relationship between sensory processing differences and anxiety in autistic individuals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sensory sensitivity often correlates with increased anxiety levels</li>
                    <li>Sensory avoidance behaviors may develop as a coping mechanism</li>
                    <li>Environmental modifications can help reduce anxiety</li>
                    <li>Individual differences in sensory processing impact anxiety presentation</li>
                </ul>
