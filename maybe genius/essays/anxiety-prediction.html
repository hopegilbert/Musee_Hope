                <h1>Does Sensory Hyperreactivity Predict Anxiety in Autism?</h1>

                <p>Sensory Over-Reactivity (SOR)/sensory hyperreactivity is when an individual displays a high sensitivity to a stimulus. This is one of the sensory reactivity differences in autistic people (along with hyporeactivity and seeking). New diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) includes sensory reactivity. In a study by MacLennan et al., (2020)[1] 94% of the participants (pps) identified as experiencing hyperreactivity. Various studies suggest that anxiety is more common in autistic people (Nimmo-Smith et al., 2020[2] Lugnegård et al., 2011[3], Van Steensel et al., 2011)[4]. There is also evidence to suggest that there is an association between anxiety disorders and sensory reactivity differences in autistic people. Green and Ben-Sasson (2010)[5] proposed three possible theories to explain the association between SOR and anxiety disorders in autistic people.</p>

                <p>The three possible theories to explain the association between anxiety disorders and SOR in autistic children where A) SOR is caused by anxiety B) Anxiety is caused by SOR C) SOR and anxiety are causally unrelated but are associated through common risk factor or diagnostic overlap. The paper collates various studies to support the theories' suggestions.</p>

                <h2>Theory A: SOR is Caused by Anxiety</h2>
                <p>Theory A suggests that SOR is caused by anxiety. They begin by proposing the Primary Anxiety Model. Which shows hypervigilance, attention biases, difficulty regulating negative emotion, hyperarousal, avoidance and perceived uncontrollability as the symptoms of anxiety. They suggest that anxiety is the state of hypervigilance (the search and preparation for threat in the environment) which is maintained by hyperarousal (an increased responsiveness to a stimuli). This is supported by Craske (2003)[6] who suggests hypevigilance comes from negative affectivity (the predisposition to negative emotions) and difficulty with emotion regulation). The model uses the theory that anxious people are in a state of hypervigilance followed by the narrowing of attention when a threat is located and the difficulty of then shifting attention. This theory is supported by the dot probe task, used by numerous researchers to asses selective attention to threat related stimuli.</p>

                <p>Green and Ben-Sasson (2010) suggest that the hypervigilance in anxious people will mean they are more likely to locate and then react to stimuli in the environment. The model is then linked to autistic children using a study by Liss et al., (2006)[7]. Liss et al (2006) found that SOR, excellent memory and overfoucused and overselective behaviour cluster together in a subgroup of autistic children. They suggest that the reason the autistic children experience SOR is because they 'disproportionately assign attention to a central focus' and also have trouble shifting their attention. Green and Ben-Sassoon use this study to support their model as the subgroup of autistic children show similar symptoms to anxious individuals linking their SOR. However, even though the study provided good insights into the possibly sensory and attention abnormalities in autistic individuals it's limitations suggest the need for more research using larger sample sizes, better sampling methods and the use of control groups.</p>

                <p>Green and Ben-Sassoon also presented animal studies that genetically modified mice to be anxiety prone to support theory A. Lepicard et al., (2003)[8] a study provides some insights into the relationship between posture and balance responses to sensory challenges and anxiety in mice, its limitations suggest the need for further research using larger sample sizes, multiple measures to assess anxiety, posture, and balance, and controlling for potential confounding factors, found evidence to suggest poor modulation of vestibular-proprioceptive input, which Miller et al., (2007)[9] also found to be common in autistic children with SOR. Again linking behaviour observed in autistic children to anxiety disorder symptoms. This paper provides a starting point for developing a nosology for sensory integration diagnosis, its limitations suggest the need for further empirical research and external review to refine and validate the proposed diagnostic criteria. Poor modulation of vestibular-proprioceptive input was shown to be a symptom of anxiety by the administration an anxiolytic (anxiety reducer) to the anxious mice and a anxiogenic (anxiety inducer) to the normal mice. The differences in mice became reversed. Plappert and Piltz (2002)[10] found that the anxious mice showed a stronger auditory startle reaction than the non-anxious mice showing how anxiety causing SOR.</p>

                <p>While the study provides some insights into the relationship between anxiety and startle response in two inbred mouse strains, its limitations suggest the need for further research using larger sample sizes, multiple tests to assess anxiety and startle response, behavioral validation of the mouse strains used, and blinding of experimenters to the experimental conditions. The model establishes that SOR is caused by hypervigilance, hyper arousal, attention biases and poor regulation of negative emotion. The model also explains that the SOR may be maintained/exacerbated through classical conditioning. When hypervigilance leads to attention to a stimulus that causes SOR the pairing of the stimulus to the unpleasant feeling of SOR can lead to 'interoceptive conditioning'. When the conditioning occurs it is more likely that a person will become hypervigilant to the stimuli and potential adversive stimuli, then narrow their attention again and elicit another negative response. People with anxiety often use avoidance as an adaptive way to regulate a response to a stimulus. This decreases the likelihood that they will learn to regulate a response. Therefore the model suggests that through conditioning and avoidance SOR is maintained/exacerbated in response to stimuli along with potential adversive stimuli. Displaying a loop of anxiety causing SOR.</p>

                <p>The model focuses on how anxiety causes SOR. The theory looks at how symptoms of anxiety and similar/the same observed behaviour in autistic children both potentially lead to SOR. The only time the theory can be used to show hyperreactivity predicting anxiety is when the conditioning has occurred. The conditioning predicts hypervigilance/attention bias (characteristics of anxiety). An issue we may face when using this theory to predict anxiety is that it doesn't focus on anxiety in autism but anxiety disorders in general. Therefore the theory would need to be specific to anxiety in autistic people causing SOR to see if hyperreactivity would predict anxiety in autism.</p>

                <h2>Theory B: Anxiety is Caused by SOR</h2>
                <p>Theory B suggests that Anxiety is caused by SOR. It proposes the Primary SOR Model showing how classical conditioning and context conditioning can lead to anxiety. It suggests that an unpleasant stimuli can be associated with objects or sensory situations that become a conditioned stimuli that elicit a negative emotional response (fear or anxiety). Research suggests that specific phobias are commonly found in autistic children, which is in line with the Primary SOR model. Green and Ben-Sassoon suggest that a general anxiety may occur through context conditioning, as the conditioned stimuli can occur unpredictably, uncontrollably and frequently. This means the conditioned fear response can change from being triggered by a specific object to a location or context surrounding the object. This can lead to avoidance of general locations alongside the specific stimulus. Green and Sassoon state that autistic children with SOR are at high risk of fear conditioning as they react intensely to sensory stimuli. The context conditioning can lead to the anxiety symptoms of hypervigilance, avoidance and hyperarousal- maintaining the anxiety towards the stimulus creating a constant general anxiety. They also touch on how SOR could cause attention bias towards the perceived threatening stimuli and suggest it could contribute to the development of anxiety.</p>

                <p>This theory supports the idea that hyperreactivity can predict anxiety in autistic people. It specifically addresses autistic people rather than general anxiety disorders. It provides evidence that specific phobias are commonly found in autistic people and that autistic people with SOR are more susceptible to conditioning because of their intense reactions to sensory stimuli. The theory is useful in explaining how hyperreactivity can predict anxiety in autistic people as the theoretical pathway of the model breaks down how and when anxiety can be predicted.</p>

                <h2>Theory C: Non-Causal Association</h2>
                <p>Theory C looks at the non-causal explanations for the association between SOR and anxiety. It proposes that SOR and anxiety could be associated through a general risk factor such as amygdala abnormalities or overlapping diagnostic criteria. Green and Ben-Sassoon use Zald (2003)[11]'s meta analysis of the engagement of the amygdala to support the idea that the amygdala 'plays a central role in the detection and response to threat' and that amygdala activation is based off the perceived unpleasantness of a stimuli, dictating the sensory response. It is suggested that autistic children with SOR may have overreactive amygdalas. Revisitng Liss et al., (2006)'s findings that SOR is clustered with good memory and over-focused attention in a subgroup of autistic children, the amygdala could contribute to their good memory because of it's links to the hippocampus. Green and Ben-Sassoon use supporting evidence from Markram (2008)[12]'s rat studies, that found rats with autistic symptoms had twice the amygdala activation compared to normal rats. The rats with autistic symptoms were more likely to generalise fear responses to new contexts suggesting that the over-reactive amygdala may lead to over-encoding and generalised fear, findings that are consistent with autistic children. This study however, has limited generalisability, incomplete understanding of underlying mechanisms, ethical concerns about animal models, and a lack of translation to effective clinical treatments. The model suggests that the amygdala abnormalities independently contribute to SOR and anxiety disorders however the other models explain that they can exacerbate each other.</p>

                <p>Because the theory suggests the over-reactive amygdala independently contributes to SOR and anxiety we can not use it to show how hyperreactivity predicts anxiety in autism. It can explain the over-reactive amygdalas role in the development of each one but not it does not give us a theoretical pathway to predict anxiety.</p>

                <p>Because SOR and anxiety physiologically manifest themselves the same way we can use this for differential diagnosis. Parental report also has overlaps in diagnostic items making it difficult to look at associations. Research suggests differences in diagnosis between practitioners and there is need for more consistent diagnoses between them.</p>

                <p>This suggests that because there are overlaps between the two conditions we cannot say that hyperreactivity can predict anxiety and we can't differentiate whether we are looking at symptoms of an anxiety disorder or SOR.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Green and Ben-Sassoon's findings presented us with an increased understanding of the relationship between anxiety and SOR in autistic children which can help inform the development of effective interventions. It gave a comprehensive assessment of anxiety disorders and SOR increasing the validity of the findings. The findings have practical applications for working with autistic children and the importance of addressing both anxiety disorders and SOR in treatment. However, the studies that the paper references and uses for evidentiary support are limited in generalisability as they do not apply to all autistic individuals. The study did not explore the causal relationships between anxiety disorders and SOR in autistic children which leaves questions about the relationship unanswered still. Considering this study's theories it is difficult to agree with the idea that hyperreactivity predicts anxiety in autism. Theory A has limited relevance to this, Theory B wholly supports the idea and Theory C does not give evidence that SOR can predict anxiety in autism. Therefore I believe there is not enough evidence to suggest hyperreactivity predicts anxiety in autism.</p>
