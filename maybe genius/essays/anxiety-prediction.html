                <h1>Does Sensory Hyperreactivity Predict Anxiety in Autism?</h1>

                <p>Sensory Over-Reactivity (SOR)/sensory hyperreactivity is when an individual displays a high sensitivity to a stimulus. This is one of the sensory reactivity differences in autistic people (along with hyporeactivity and seeking). New diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) includes sensory reactivity. In a study by MacLennan et al., (2020) 94% of the participants (pps) identified as experiencing hyperreactivity. Various studies suggest that anxiety is more common in autistic people (Nimmo-Smith et al., 2020, Lugnegård et al., 2011, Van Steensel et al., 2011). There is also evidence to suggest that there is an association between anxiety disorders and sensory reactivity differences in autistic people. Green and Ben-Sasson (2010) proposed three possible theories to explain the association between SOR and anxiety disorders in autistic people.</p>

                <h2>Three Theories of Association</h2>
                <p>The three possible theories to explain the association between anxiety disorders and SOR in autistic children where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A) SOR is caused by anxiety</li>
                    <li>B) Anxiety is caused by SOR</li>
                    <li>C) SOR and anxiety are causally unrelated but are associated through common risk factor or diagnostic overlap</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Theory A: SOR is Caused by Anxiety</h2>
                <p>Theory A suggests that SOR is caused by anxiety. They begin by proposing the Primary Anxiety Model. Which shows hypervigilance, attention biases, difficulty regulating negative emotion, hyperarousal, avoidance and perceived uncontrollability as the symptoms of anxiety. They suggest that anxiety is the state of hypervigilance (the search and preparation for threat in the environment) which is maintained by hyperarousal (an increased responsiveness to a stimuli).</p>

                <p>This is supported by Craske (2003) who suggests hypevigilance comes from negative affectivity (the predisposition to negative emotions) and difficulty with emotion regulation). The model uses the theory that anxious people are in a state of hypervigilance followed by the narrowing of attention when a threat is located and the difficulty of then shifting attention.</p>

                <h2>Supporting Evidence for Theory A</h2>
                <p>Green and Ben-Sasson (2010) suggest that the hypervigilance in anxious people will mean they are more likely to locate and then react to stimuli in the environment. The model is then linked to autistic children using a study by Liss et al., (2006). Liss et al (2006) found that SOR, excellent memory and overfoucused and overselective behaviour cluster together in a subgroup of autistic children.</p>

                <h2>Theory B: Anxiety is Caused by SOR</h2>
                <p>Theory B suggests that Anxiety is caused by SOR. It proposes the Primary SOR Model showing how classical conditioning and context conditioning can lead to anxiety. It suggests that an unpleasant stimuli can be associated with objects or sensory situations that become a conditioned stimuli that elicit a negative emotional response (fear or anxiety).</p>

                <h2>Theory C: Non-Causal Association</h2>
                <p>Theory C looks at the non-causal explanations for the association between SOR and anxiety. It proposes that SOR and anxiety could be associated through a general risk factor such as amygdala abnormalities or overlapping diagnostic criteria.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Considering this study's theories it is difficult to agree with the idea that hyperreactivity predicts anxiety in autism. Theory A has limited relevance to this, Theory B wholly supports the idea and Theory C does not give evidence that SOR can predict anxiety in autism. Therefore I believe there is not enough evidence to suggest hyperreactivity predicts anxiety in autism.</p>
