                <h1>Improving Organisational Functioning</h1>
                <h2>Key Factors for Success</h2>

                <p>The purpose of organisational functioning stems from organisational psychology which 'focuses mainly on taking care of corporate interests and the needs of employees. This seeks to provide a better life and better conditions for employees in their companies to help them be more productive and efficient in their organisation.' (Al-Abri et al., 2021).  Determining the most significant aspects of organisational functioning depends on a company's specific factors such as industry, size, culture and current challenges. However, based on their broad impact on organisational performance and employee well-being I would consider the following three aspects to be most significant when discussing organisational functioning within companies in general.</p>

                <p>Firstly, effective leadership and management styles are fundamental to organisational success. The leaders are the people who set the visions, goals and directions for the organisation and management ensure these tasks are executed efficiently. Leadership style influences organisational culture, employee motivation and overall performance. Effective management practices contribute to employee satisfaction, productivity and retention. Secondly, good employee motivation and work satisfaction is essential for any organisation. Motivation drives employees to make an effort and push through challenges to pursue organisational goals. Satisfaction is the extent to which employees feel content, fulfilled and happy with their work and overall organisation experience. Organisations that prioritise employee motivation and satisfaction tend to experience higher productivity, lower turn over and higher customer satisfaction. Finally, organisational culture shapes the values, norms and behaviours of an organisation. An organisation characterised by trust, collaboration and innovation fosters employee well-being, engagement and performance. A good organisational culture can influence morale, productivity and effectiveness.</p>

                <h2>Leadership and Management</h2>
                <p>Leadership plays a pivotal role in shaping culture, performance and success of an organisation. Effective leadership encompasses a range of qualities and behaviours, that inspire, guide and empower individuals and teams to achieve common goals.</p>

                <p>Antonakis and Day (2018) suggest that it is evident that there is 'a widespread belief that leadership is vital for effective organisational and societal functioning.' They also propose that leadership is difficult to define given its complex nature, however, propose that  'leadership is a formal or informal contextually routed and goal-influencing process that occurs between a leader and a follower, groups of followers, or institutions.' This also stresses that leadership is a two-way street and that leaders and followers interact to form leadership.</p>

                <p>Having discussed a definition of leadership, it is important to differentiate leaders from managers. Just because someone is in a formal position doesn't mean that they have influence over others along with, a formal position is not required to take over responsibility, develop a vision or provide structure and guidance. This fits nicely with the widely known saying 'not all leaders are managers, but not all managers are leaders.' Zaleznik (1981) said that 'managers tend to adopt impersonal attitudes towards goals.' Whereas leaders 'develop approaches to long-standing problems and to open issues for new options.' This idea shows that managers' 'instinct for survival dominates their need for risk' unlike leaders. This is evidence for the importance of structure and hierarchal positions within an organisation to better organisational functioning. Leadership is not just who has the best ideas and relationships, it is in fact someone who provides structure and ensures tasks are completed efficiently for the best outcome for the company. With effective management practices a company thrives in satisfaction, productivity and retention.</p>

                <h2>Work Satisfaction and Motivation</h2>
                <p>Work satisfaction is vital to improving organisational functioning because of its direct links to performance. Judge et al., (2001) found that on average job satisfaction positively correlated with performance, implying that happier employees are more likely to be productive, displaying job satisfaction leads to better organisational functioning. Also, positive experiences at work foster organisational commitment, which leads to better performance and improved organisational functioning. This is important for employee retention as turnovers can reduce organisational functioning.</p>

                <p>It is important that employees feel motivated to stay and work hard in an organisation. Ryan and Deci (2000) proposed self-determination theory (SDT), this looks at human motivation and personality. Central to the theory are the innate psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness. Autonomy is to the desire for self-endorsement in one's actions, competence involves the pursuit of effectiveness, and relatedness emphasises the importance of relationships and connections. Deci and Ryan argue that by fulfilling these needs we foster motivation, well being and personal growth. This is highlights the importance of facilitating these psychological needs within a culture to improve organisational functioning.</p>

                <h2>Organisational Culture</h2>
                <p>Organisational culture is important for organisational functioning as it is the 'glue that holds organisations together.' (van den Berg & Wilderom, 2004). Organisational culture is crucial to shaping organisational functioning and can have a significant impact of success.</p>

                <p>Organisational culture establishes the identity and personality of an organisation. It reflects shared values, beliefs and norms that guide employee behaviour and decision making. This is important because a positive culture helps organisations to stand out, attract top talent, and foster work satisfaction. Kotter and Hessket (1992) surveyed 207 firms and found that a strong culture unites and motivates staff and increases internal integration. Cultural strength also has moderate correlations with economic success and stronger correlations to stable work environments (retention). Therefore we can see the importance of a strong culture for organisational functioning.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In conclusion, the improvement of organisational functioning relies of several interconnected factors, with effective leadership, work satisfaction and organisational culture emerging as the most significant. Leadership sets the tone for organisational success by providing vision, direction and support, while work satisfaction and motivation drive productivity, engagement and retention. Furthermore, Organisational culture shapes the values, behaviours and overall environment within an organisation, influencing employee morale and performance. By addressing these factors holistically and implementing strategies to enhance them, organisations can foster a positive and productive work environment conducive to sustained success. However, it is essential to recognise the dynamic and interdependent nature of these factors and to continually adapt and evolve organisational practices to meet the changing needs and challenges of the modern business landscape. Ultimately, by prioritising effective leadership, promoting work satisfaction and cultivating a positive organisational culture, organisations can optimise their functioning and achieve their goals in an increasingly competitive global market.</p>
