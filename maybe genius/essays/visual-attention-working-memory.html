                <h1>Visual Attention and Working Memory: Independent or Interconnected?</h1>
                
                <div class="author-info">
                    <p>By Hope Gilbert</p>
                </div>

                <p>The relationship between visual attention and working memory (WM) is being continuously studied. The working memory model (WMM) proposed by Baddeley (2000) is a multi-component model used for temporarily storing and manipulating information. Visual attention, on the other hand, is about selective attention to relevant visual stimuli (driven by bottom-up and top-down mechanisms). This essay explores whether visual attention and WM are independent concepts or not. By analysing empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks from research studies, I aim to discuss the interaction between these processes.</p>

                <p>Whilst arguing whether visual attention and WM are independent concepts or not, it is first important to understand what these cognitive processes are. Beginning with working memory, Baddeley's (2000) proposal of the WMM. 'The working memory model posited that as opposed to the simplistic functions of short-term memory in providing short-term storage of information, working memory is a multi-component system that manipulates information storage for greater and more complex cognitive utility' (Chai et al., 2018). WM is the cognitive system that is responsible for temporal storage and the manipulation of information that is required for complex cognitive tasks. These tasks include reasoning, decision-making, and language comprehension. It is often thought of as a mental workspace where information that comes from sensory inputs and long-term memory (LTM) is maintained and manipulated to support cognitive processes.</p>

                <p>Following on from an overview of WM, it is crucial to understand the components that make up the WMM. The WMM is made up of four components: the central executive which is the control center, (it) directs attention and coordinates information processing and manages resources; the phonological loop responsible for the temporary storage and rehearsal of auditory and verbal information, consists of two stores, the phonological store (which holds auditory information from speech) and the articulatory rehearsal process (which maintains information through subvocal rehearsal); the visuospatial sketchpad which is involved in the temporary storage and manipulation of spatial and visual information, allows for mental imagery, spatial reasoning, and manipulation of visual representations in WM tasks; the episodic buffer Integrates information from various sources, including sensory inputs and long-term memory (LTM), as well as the outputs from the other WM systems. It is a temporary storage space where information can be collated and merged. (Tutor2u, 2021).</p>

                <p>The visuospatial sketchpad, a component of the WMM, is crucial for temporarily storing and manipulating visual and spatial information. Divided into two parts (Logie 1995), the visual cache, (which handles form and colour) and the inner scribe, (responsible for spatial location and movement). The visuospatial sketchpad enables mental representation and manipulation of images, spatial relationships, and patterns. This component supports cognitive functions like mental imagery, spatial reasoning, navigation, and problem-solving.</p>

                <p>Referring back to the previous paragraphs, WM is crucial for a range of cognitive activities; problem-solving, comprehension, planning and decision-making. However, it has long been understood that WM is a limited capacity system, (Chai et al., 2018) this is also true for the visuospatial sketchpad on its own, which means it can only hold a limited amount of information. Capacity in WM can vary among individuals due to individual differences, cognitive load and the complexity of tasks, and can be influenced by training, age and cognitive abilities.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, Zhang and Luck (2008) tested the hypothesis that visual WM (vWM) stores a limited set of items (3/4 independent memory 'slots') with fixed representations. The experiment was a short-term recall paradigm and the probability of a probed item being stored in vWM was recorded, along with standard deviation (s.d.) to reflect the precision or resolution of the memory representation. It was found that the more items presented the worse the recall of the probed item was. This showed that vWM can only store a limited set of items. The s.d. increased with more presented items however plateaued after three presented items. This shows vWM stores a small number of representations with good precision, therefore this experiment showed that there is a capacity limit to vWM and therefore only a fixed number of objects can be stored. vWM is made up of a fixed number of slots for discrete fixed precision representation. (Zhang and Luck, 2008)</p>

                <p>Conversely, Bays, Catalao and Hussain (2009) challenged Zhang and Luck's (2008) limited vWM model and instead tested the idea that a single memory resource must be shared out between visual items. They did a similar experiment; however, they incorporated eye-tracking control for fixation. They measured the s.d. of the error in pps responses: zero indicated chance performance. They found that the error in memory for location increased as the number of items presented increased (pps tend to report the colour of the wrong item more frequently). They also found precision decreased with an increase in items as well, and random responses (unrelated to the sample items) increased as items increased. Therefore, the precision with which pps report the colour of the item declines with an increasing number of items. However, this decline is due to variability in colour and position rather than a limit in the number of items that can be stored. This, therefore, challenges Zhang and Luck's, 2008 model that vWM has 3/4 independent memory 'slots'. (Bays et al., 2009)</p>

                <p>After considering the WM and vWM it is important to now understand visual attention to be able to understand whether they are separate concepts. Visual attention and working memory are closely linked cognitive processes that interact to support perception, cognition, and behaviour- but are they closely linked or the same?</p>

                <p>Visual attention refers to the cognitive process of focusing on specific visual stimuli (Visual Attention - an Overview | ScienceDirect Topics, 2009). It allows an individual to focus on relevant information in the visual environment. Visual attention is made up of various processes: visual attention uses selective attention to focus our cognitive resources on specific visual stimuli and filter out irrelevant information. Visual attention can either be guided by both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Visual attention plays a key role in visual search tasks, efficient visual search relies on good attentional mechanisms that detect relevant information. Another key part of visual attention is attentional shifting and disengagement, this allows individuals to change visual targets and flexible behaviour for adapting to environmental demands. Most relevant to this discussion is top-down and bottom-up attention. Top-down attention is driven by internal goals, expectations and cognitive strategies, and directs attention based on task demand and previous knowledge.</p>

                <p>Whereas bottom-up attention is driven by external stimulus and captures attention involuntarily.</p>

                <p>In support of the idea that visual attention is bottom-up guided is Theewes' (1992) argument that attention is automatic. This is where we select the most salient item in the visual field. If selection can be controlled pps will select the shape target and ignore the distractor but if a distractor is salient enough it will automatically capture attention. Reaction times were increased in distractor present trials because the distractor captured attention and delayed response in contrast to trials without a distractor. This proved that attentional selection is bottom-up guided and determined by stimulus salience- the selection is automatic and cannot be controlled volitionally. (Theewes, 1992).</p>

                <p>However, there is an alternative view to Theewes' research; Folk et al., 1992 suggested that attentional selection is controlled by our search intentions. Event relevance is top-down and controlled by behavioural goals (we select what is relevant to us). Folk et al., did a spatial cueing paradigm study to research if selection can be controlled, colour-queuing will lead to faster reaction times for colour targets but not for onset targets (because colour is not task-relevant for onset targets). However, if attention is automatic there will be cueing effects for both colour and onset targets irrespective of whether the cue matches the task set to not (because any salient cue will capture attention). He found that spatial cueing effects for cues that are task-relevant, but not for cues that do not match the task set. This shows that attentional selection is top-down controlled and determined by selectional intentions; selectional attention is not automatic and depends on search goals. Salient events only capture attention when they are task-relevant and part of the top-down task set. Salient but task-irrelevant objects can be ignored (Folk et al., 1992)</p>

                <p>But how can the conflicting findings of Theewes (1992) bottom-up guided compared to the top-down controlled findings of Folk et al., (1992) be resolved? There are methodological differences between the two as they are different paradigms, and the tasks result in measures of attentional capture at different time points. Alongside there being conceptual differences, the two different search modes facilitate either bottom-up or top-down selection (Bacon and Egeth, 1994). Singleton search mode during pop-out search leads to bottom-up guided selection and feature search mode during feature search leads to top-down controlled selection.</p>

                <p>After considering Zhang and Luck's (2008) model versus Bays, Catalao and Hussain's (2009) challenge for vWM, and Theewes (1992) versus Folk's (1992) research on automatic versus controlled attention, we can now begin to look at the way the interactions between visual attention and working memory; are they independent concepts?</p>

                <p>When looking at the interactions between visual attention and working memory, it can be broken down; how does attention affect memory? And how does memory affect attention? The way memory works can be broken down into the findings of how memory- the vWM in the WMM specifically- works. Referring back, the WMM is a short-term memory (STM) model (Dixon, 2023), and more specifically, this means that the visuospatial sketchpad has a limited capacity (Zhang and Luck, 2008) and is encoded (the initial stage at which information is taken from the environment) visually/spatially (Baddeley and Hitch, 1974).</p>

                <p>To illustrate whether encoding in WM and attention are separate processes Vogel et al., (2005) suggested that attentional selection precedes and controls WM encoding. They did a study to examine selection mechanisms for allocating memory capacity, they did three experiments including visual memory tasks whilst recording event-related potentials (ERPs) to measure neural correlates of memory selection. They found that pps vary in their ability to control what is stored in WM, high-capacity pps were more efficient at excluding irrelevant information, this could be due to differences in prefrontal cortex function. The study also highlights that memory capacity may not only reflect the number of items that can be stored but also how efficiently individuals allocate memory resources.</p>

                <p>In contrast to Vogel et al., (2005), Mayer et al., (2007) suggested that attention and working memory rely on a common capacity-limited cognitive mechanism. If there is a capacity limit of vWM it is reflected in the posterior parietal cortex by a load-dependent increase in blood oxygen level-dependent activation that reaches a plateau when the capacity limit is reached, a high demand of both vWM and attention would mean performance (if they share capacity-limited cognitive and neural resources would become exhausted in conditions that are high demanding of both vWM and attention, resulting in interference). They aimed to manipulate the demand on WM and attention in a single task to identify brain areas that show an interference effect. They found that when there is an easy search for a target there is greater accuracy but slower response time in WM load, and reversely, great accuracy and faster response time in high WM load. This suggests that when it comes to a tricky task the mental resources will become limited and attention and WM are fighting for resources.</p>

                <p>Moving on from encoding in WM and attention, another comparison to consider is does attention affects WM maintenance. Awh et al., (1998) suggested that attention does affect WM in a study that aims to investigate the role of rehearsal in WM. The study used a dual-task paradigm to see whether rehearsal processes are important for maintaining information in WM. In their study, they manipulated rehearsal demands whilst pps performed memory tasks. They found that even when attention is directed away, performance in WM tasks stays intact. This suggests that attention and rehearsal can operate independently.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, Chan et al., (2009) proposed an opposite view to Awh et al., (1998) suggesting that attention does not affect WM. The study explores the relationship between WM maintenance and attention. The study used visual search tasks to discover whether attention is necessary for maintaining information in WM. They manipulated attentional load in the maintenance phase of a WM task. The results showed that by increasing attentional load performance in WM maintenance is impaired. This suggests that attention plays a key role in this process and contributes to the understanding of how WM and attention interact.</p>

                <p>Now moving away from how attention affects memory and transitioning to how memory affects attention; Pertzov et al., (2013) suggested that attention does affect WM retrieval. The study looks at 'rapid forgetting' in vWM. In a series of experiments, they examined how visual information in vWM deteriorates over time. They suggested that items stored in vWM compete for limited resources, which leads to 'rapid forgetting'. These findings suggest that the decay of information in vWM is also influenced by the competition among other stored items.</p>

                <p>Although, the opposite of Pertzov et al., (2013) is found in a study by Rerko et al., stating that attention does not affect WM retrieval. They explored retro-cue benefits (RCB) in WM and its relationship with sustained focal attention (SFA). This involves directing attention back to a specific item in WM after encoding. In their experiments, they investigated if RCB could occur without SFA on a cued item. The results suggested that RCB can occur independently, this challenges the assumption that continuous attention is needed for WM maintenance.</p>

                <p>Still on the topic of whether attention and working memory are separate processes or not, along with linking back to capacity limits, Houtcamp and Roelfsema's (2009) study suggests visual attention is guided by a single search template. They investigated the capacity of the visual system to match visual input to individual items. In their experiments, they researched whether the visual system can simultaneously match multiple visual inputs to corresponding items or if it can only match one item at a time. They found that the visual system is limited to matching visual input to only one item at a time, suggesting a sequential rather than parallel processing mechanism.</p>

                <p>As opposed to Grubert and Eimer's (2016) findings that visual attention is guided by multiple simultaneously activated search templates. In their experiments, they examined whether attentional control settings can be simultaneously maintained for multiple target colours. They found that pps can maintain simultaneous attentional control settings for multiple target colours and show that attentional control can be flexible. This, therefore, challenges the previous findings that control is limited.</p>

                <p>To conclude, by examining visual attention and WM we can begin to understand their dynamic interaction. Research does present conflicting views on whether they are independent or not, however, it highlights how they are interconnected and have a mutual influence. More research into this discussion needs to be done to further understand the complexity of these processes.</p>
